The facility coordinates in this SPA GPS dataset represent the true location of the facility and are NOT displaced.
The coordinates may not align precisely with GIS data from other sources due to generalization of administrative boundaries
or slight discrepancies between shapefiles

For the purposes of this survey, the Ouest Metropolitaine region is made up of the urban areas of 6 communes:
Carrefour, Cité Soleil, Delmas, Pétion-Ville, Port-Au-Prince, and Tabarre. Facilities located in these areas have “Aire Metropolitaine”
as their locality in the data file, while facilities in rural areas of these communes are grouped with those in the “Autre Ouest”
region and have “Localité” as their locality. The urban/rural and locality classifications given in the facility dataset for this
survey are those provided by the Haitian government at the time of the survey. It is possible that certain areas of the country have
changed in the intervening period due to population growth and movement.

SPAID = DHSCC&"SPA"&SPAYEAR&SPAFACID (with 8 digits) from survey documentation

DHSCC = 2 letter DHS country code (http://www.dhsprogram.com/data/File-Types-and-Names.cfm)

FIPSCC = Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 2 letter country code (http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip10-4.htm)

SPAYEAR = 4 digit year of data collection from the survey documentation

SPAFACID = integer cluster identification number

ADM1CODE = first sub-national administrative division code when sampling is representative at the Admin 1 level

ADM1NAME = first sub-national administrative division name when sampling is representative at the Admin 1 level

SPAREGCO = integer region code associated with the SPA region created for sampling

SPAREGNA = name associated with the SPA region created for sampling

SPATYPEC = facility type code as classified in the survey data file

SPATYPEN = facility type name as classified in the survey data file

SPAMANGC = facility managing organization code as classified in the survey data file

SPAMANGN = facility managing organization name as classified in the survey data file

SOURCE = source of data used to determine the latitude and longitude values
“GPS” for data collected by the survey team
"MFL" for Master Facility List or preexisting data provided by the government
“GAZ” for data extracted from a gazetteer of village/place names
"MIS" for clusters in which data could not be fully verified

LATNUM = facility's latitude coordinate in decimal degrees

LONGNUM = facility's longitude coordinate in decimal degrees

DATUM = "WGS84" for the geographic coordinate system World Geodetic System (WGS) 1984
